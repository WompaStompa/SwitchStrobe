The file containing the colors has to be named "colors.txt" without the quotes. "colors.txt" does not have to be all lowercased. Colors have to be hex values of the form BBGGRR. For example, 8807ff would be Blue:136, Green:7, and Red:255. Casing doesn't matter for hex values. One hex value per line.
